GeekNight Recife WebSite

#### What is this?
The main reason of this project is build a blog to share what have been happening on Geek Night Recife - an open space for geeks to connect, discuss & learn latest ideas, technologies and trends in software development.

#### How it works?
We are using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to serve the blog posts and we changed the layout and added css.
So, if you want to run the project you just need to do:  
  
`$ jekyll serve`
